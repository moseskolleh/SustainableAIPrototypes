## 🎯 Overview

This project addresses a critical challenge: **How do we make the environmental impact of AI usage visible and actionable?**

Based on extensive research with Ministry of Finance employees (70% aware & willing to change), we've developed six refined prototypes that combine the best features from initial concepts with eco-friendly alternatives research.

### Key Principles

1. **Respect User Intelligence** - Inform, don't restrict
2. **Make It Immediate** - Real-time feedback at decision points
3. **Seamless Integration** - Embed in existing workflows
4. **Celebrate Progress** - Positive reinforcement over guilt

### Impact Goals

- 📉 **25% reduction** in AI-related CO₂ emissions
- ⚡ **20% cost savings** through efficiency
- 🎓 **80% employee engagement** with sustainable practices
- 🏆 **Model organization** for government sustainability

## 🌟 Vision

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

We believe technology and sustainability are not just compatible—they're inseparable. Every query, every line of code, every decision has an environmental footprint. By making the invisible visible, we empower people to make informed choices without sacrificing productivity.

**This project proves that awareness + action + gamification = real behavior change.**
